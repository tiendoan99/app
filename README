		4) Type in these codes:
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:1,0"
  }

ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}
		5) Go back to your home directory, use this command "nano .asoundrc" and then type in the same code above
		6) Run “alsamixer” command to check if your device is registered
		7) If the device isn't registered, use “sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list” command and add the last line:
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
# Uncomment line below then 'apt-get update' to enable 'apt-get source'
#deb-src http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi
deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ wheezy main contrib non-free rpi
		8) Run “sudo apt-get update”
		9) Run “sudo aptitude versions alsa-utils” to check if version 1.0.25 of alsa-util is available
		10) Run “sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4” to downgrade and then reboot
		11) Run “arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav” to test that your microphone is working. You should see a “test.wav” file in the current folder.
		12) Put earphone on the USB sound card. Run “aplay test.wav” to check that your recording is okay.
		*******SET UP LIBCURL*********
		13) First use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or "ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl library is installed.
		14) If the folder doesn’t exist. Run “sudo apt-get update” to update the application list.
		15) Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl3” to install the libcurl3.
		16) Run “sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev” to install the development API of libcurl4.
	3. Operating Instructions
		1) Use command "make clean" to clear all running program
		2) Use command "make" to update the program
		3) Use command "./sound.out" to run the record and sound analize  program
		4) Use command "./sound.out arg" to run the sound maker program
		5) Use command "scp testTone.wav *your email address*:." to copy the sound file you just made from the program
